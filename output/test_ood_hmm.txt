When WRB
Tyler NNP
was VBD
very RB
young JJ
, ,
his PRP$
grandmother NN
was VBD
his PRP$
favorite JJ
person NN
in IN
the DT
world NN
because IN
, ,
unlike IN
his PRP$
parents NN
, ,
who WP
believed VBP
that IN

should MD
always RB
be VB
told VBN
the DT
truth NN
as IN
adults NNS
understood IN
it PRP

she PRP
would MD
fill VB
in IN
the DT
gaps NN
in IN
his PRP$
knowledge NN
— :
Santa NNP
Claus NNP
, ,
the DT
Easter JJ
Bunny NN
, ,
God NN

His PRP$
parents NN
were VBD
always RB
too RB
busy JJ
and CC
often RB
a DT
little JJ
too RB
serious JJ
, ,
but CC
his PRP$
grandmother NN
had VBD
a DT
sense NN
of IN
peace NN
about IN
her PRP
, ,
a DT
lightness NN
that WDT
lifted VBP
his PRP$
spirit NN
. .

A DT
few JJ
times NNS
, ,
when WRB
Tyler VBG
’s POS
parents NN
were VBD
away RB
, ,
she PRP
took VBD
him VBN
with IN
her PRP
to IN
church NN

He PRP
remembered MD
liking VB
the DT
singing NN
and CC
the DT
colorful JJ
windows NN
, ,
and CC
how WRB
safe JJ
he PRP
felt VBP
there RB
, ,
in IN
that DT
large JJ
, ,
empty JJ
space NN
, ,
sitting VBG
on IN
a DT
hard JJ
bench NN
next NN
to IN
her PRP$
warmth NN

When WRB
she PRP
died VBP
, ,
grief NNP
overwhelmed NNP
Tyler NNP
. .

But CC
like IN
most JJS
adults NNS
, ,
when WRB
he PRP
grew VBD
older JJR
he PRP
could MD
only RB
recall VB
the DT
intensity NN
of IN
that WDT
love VBP
in IN
childhood NN
in IN
an DT
abstract JJ
way NN
. .

He PRP
made VBD
the DT
common JJ
error NN
of IN
identifying JJ
maturity NN
with IN
worth JJ
, ,
and CC
assumed NN
that IN
the DT
love NN
he PRP
had VBD
for IN
her PRP
as IN
a DT
young NN
child NNS
must MD
have VB
been VBN
lacking NN
in IN
strength NN
and CC
depth NN
. .

For IN
many JJ
years NNS
after IN
her PRP$
death NN
, ,
however RB
, ,
Tyler NNP
was VBD
tortured VBN
by IN
the DT
memory NN
of IN
a DT
certain JJ
visit NN
from IN
her PRP
. .

He PRP
was VBD
five CD
or CC
so RB
, ,
and CC
they PRP
were VBD
playing VBG
some DT
board JJ
game NN
at IN
the DT
kitchen NN
table NN
. .

As IN
he PRP
swung VBP
his PRP$
legs NNS
in IN
his PRP$
excitement NN
, ,
he PRP
kicked VBP
her PRP$
repeatedly NN
in IN
the DT
shins NN
. .

She VB
asked VBN
him PRP
to TO
stop VB
, ,
and CC
he PRP
refused VBP
, ,
giggling NN
. .

When WRB
she PRP
finally RB
frowned VBN
at IN
him PRP
and CC
threatened JJ
to TO
stop VB
playing VBG
if IN
he PRP
did VBD
n’t RB
stop VB
he PRP
told VBP
her PRP
to TO
go VB
to TO
Hell VB
. .

In IN
Tyler NNP
’s POS
mind NN
he PRP
could MD
see VB
her PRP
face VBP
grow JJ
taut NN
, ,
lose VB
color NN
, ,
and CC
then RB
, ,
for IN
the DT
only JJ
time NN
he PRP
could MD
remember VB
, ,
she PRP
began VBD
to TO
cry VB
. .

He PRP
also RB
remembered VB
his PRP$
own JJ
utter JJ
confusion NN
. .

His PRP$
parents NN
did VBD
not RB
have VBP
much RB
use VB
for IN
religion NN
and CC
so RB
for IN
him PRP
Hell VBP
was VBD
a DT
word NN
without IN
much JJ
mystery NN
or CC
power NN
. .

At IN
that DT
time NN
he PRP
knew VBP
only RB
vaguely RB
that IN
Hell NNP
was VBD
a DT
place NN
you PRP
did VBD
not RB
want VBP
to TO
go VB
, ,
like IN
the DT
dark JJ
basement NN
or CC
the DT
even RB
darker JJR
attic NN
. .

He PRP
remembered VBP
feeling VBG
resentful NN
that IN
she PRP
was VBD
crying VBN
and CC
he PRP
did VBD
not RB
even RB
understand VB
why WRB
. .

Tyler RB
felt VB
the DT
guilt NN
of IN
this DT
memory NN
even RB
in IN
his PRP$
teenage JJ
years NNS
. .

For IN
him PRP
it PRP
summed VBP
up RP
all PDT
his PRP$
insecurities NN
and CC
fears NN
about IN
his PRP$
own JJ
cruelty NN
, ,
ignorance NNP
, ,
and CC
the DT
possibility NN
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
, ,
in IN
reality NN
, ,
not RB
a DT
good JJ
person NN
. .

The DT
fact NN
that IN
he PRP
had VBD
caused JJ
someone NN
who WP
loved VBP
him PRP
such JJ
pain NN
with IN
so RB
little JJ
effort NN
and CC
understanding NNP
troubled NNP
him NNP
deeply NNP
. .

One CD
day NN
Tyler NN
looked NN
through IN
an DT
old JJ
family NN
photo NN
album NN
, ,
and CC
in IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
picture NN
of IN
the DT
kitchen NN
in IN
the DT
house NN
they PRP
used VBN
to TO
live VB
in RP
. .

He PRP
was VBD
surprised VBN
to TO
discover VB
that IN
the DT
small JJ
kitchen NN
contained IN
a DT
central JJ
island NN
, ,
and CC
had VBD
no DT
space NN
for IN
the DT
table NN
in IN
his PRP$
memory NN
at IN
all DT
. .

With IN
the DT
discovery NN
of IN
that DT
single JJ
error NN
in IN
his PRP$
memory NN
came VBD
a DT
cascade NN
of IN
other JJ
revelations NN
. .

Now VB
he PRP
remembered VBP
that IN
they PRP
always RB
ate VBN
in IN
the DT
dining NN
room NN
, ,
and CC
when WRB
they PRP
did VBD
play VB
board JJ
games NN
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
always RB
on IN
the DT
coffee NN
table NN
in IN
the DT
living VBG
room NN
. .

The DT
memory NN
that WDT
had VBD
caused VBN
him PRP
such JJ
pain NN
over IN
the DT
years NNS
could MD
not RB
possibly RB
have VB
occurred NN
. .

Somehow NNP
, ,
he PRP
must MD
have VB
manufactured IN
the DT
whole JJ
scene NN
in IN
his PRP$
imagination NN
. .

It PRP
was VBD
not RB
very RB
hard JJ
to TO
explain VB
what WP
really RB
happened JJ
, ,
he PRP
thought VBD
. .

The DT
death NN
of IN
his PRP$
grandmother NN
had VBD
probably RB
caused VBN
in IN
him PRP
feelings VBP
of IN
abandonment NN
and CC
guilt NN
. .

In IN
his PRP$
confusion NN
he PRP
had VBD
taken VBN
elements NNS
from IN
storybooks NN
and CC
imagined VB
out RP
of IN
nothing NN
this DT
memory NN
to TO
punish VB
himself NN
. .

This DT
was VBD
the DT
sort NN
of IN
fantasy NN
that WDT
could MD
have VB
occurred NN
to IN
any DT
young NN
child NNS
who WP
lost VBD
an DT
important JJ
relative NN
. .

With IN
that DT
realization NN
, ,
the DT
image NN
of IN
his PRP$
grandmother JJ
crying NN
faded NN
in IN
his PRP$
memory NN
and CC
became VBD
less RBR
and CC
less JJR
believable NN
. .

Tyler NNP
thought VBD
he PRP
was VBD
very RB
lucky JJ
to TO
have VB
discovered VBN
the DT
single JJ
error NN
in IN
his PRP$
false JJ
memory NN
, ,
which WDT
enabled VBP
him PRP
to TO
reason VB
his PRP$
way NN
into IN
distinguishing NN
between IN
reality NN
and CC
fantasy NN
. .

He PRP
felt VBP
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
coming-of-age JJ
moment NN
. .

Nonetheless NNP
, ,
he PRP
admitted VBP
to TO
himself VB
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
a DT
little JJ
sad NN
also RB
at IN
the DT
discovery NN
. .

For IN
however RB
imaginary VBN
that IN
memory NNP
was VBD
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
also RB
a DT
part NN
of IN
his PRP$
love NN
for IN
his PRP$
grandmother NN
. .

When WRB
that DT
memory NN
lost VBD
its PRP$
compelling JJ
aura NN
of IN
truth NN
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
like IN
another DT
part NN
of IN
her PRP$
died NN
with IN
it PRP
. .

He PRP
had VBD
no DT
name NN
for IN
the DT
emptiness NN
that IN
remained NN
. .

The DT
Valley NN
of IN
Giants NN

I PRP
had VBD
buried VBN
my PRP$
parents NN
in IN
their PRP$
gray JJ
marble NN
mausoleum NN
at IN
the DT
heart NN
of IN
the DT
city NN

I PRP
had VBD
buried VBN
my PRP$
husband NN
in IN
a DT
lead JJ
box NN
sunk VBN
into IN
the DT
mud NN
of IN
the DT
bottom NN
of IN
the DT
river NN
, ,
where WRB
all PDT
the DT
riverboatmen JJ
lie NN

And CC
after IN
the DT
war NN
, ,
I PRP
had VBD
buried VBN
my PRP$
children NNS
, ,
all DT
four CD
, ,
in IN
white JJ
linen NN

in IN
the DT
new JJ
graveyards NN
plowed NN
into IN
what WP
used VBN

be VB
our PRP$
farmland NN
: :
all PDT
the DT
land NN
stretching NN
from IN
the DT
river NN
delta NN
to IN
the DT

I PRP
had VBD
one CD
granddaughter NNS
who WP
survived VBZ
the DT
war NN

I PRP
saw VBD
her PRP$
sometimes NN
: :
in IN
a DT
bright JJ
pink JJ
dress NN
, ,
a DT
sparkling JJ
drink NN
in IN
her PRP$
hand NN
, ,
on IN
the DT
arm NN
of IN
some DT
foreign JJ
officer NN
with IN
brocade NN
on IN
his PRP$
shoulders NNS
, ,
at IN
the DT
edge NN
of IN
a DT
marble JJ
patio NN
. .

She VB
never RB
looked VB
back RP
at IN
me NNP
— :
poverty NNP
and CC
failure NN
and CC
political JJ
disrepute NN
being VBG
all RB
, ,
these DT
days NNS
, ,
contagious NNP
and CC
synonymous NN

The DT
young NN
were VBD
mostly RB
dead RB

and CC
the DT
old JJ
men NNS
had VBD
been VBN
taken VBN
away RP

they PRP

to TO

important JJ
new JJ
things NNS

to TO
come VB
back RP
when WRB
they PRP
were VBD
ready JJ
to TO
contribute VB
fully RB

So RB
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
city NN
of IN
grandmothers NN

And CC
it PRP
was VBD
in IN
a DT
grandmother JJ
bar NN
by IN
the DT
waterfront NN
— :
sipping JJ
hot JJ
tea NN
with IN
rum NN
and CC
watching NN
over IN
the DT

dockworkers NNP
playing NNP
mah-jongg NNP
— :
that WDT
I PRP
first RB
heard VBN
of IN
the DT

We VB
all DT

for IN
a DT

with IN
a DT
crooked JJ
nose NN
and CC
rouge JJ
caked NN
in IN
the DT

who WP

incensed VBN

“ ``

” ''
she PRP
cried VBP

“ ``
You PRP

" ''

The DT
traveler NN
stood NNS
up RP
from IN
the DT
table NN

She NNP
was VBD
bony VBN
and CC
rough-skinned NN
and CC
bent NN
like IN
an DT
old JJ
crow NN
, ,
with IN
a DT
blue JJ
silk NN
scarf NN
and CC
hanks NN
of IN

as IN

Her NNP
eyes NNP
were VBD
veined VBN
with IN
red JJ

“ ``
Nonetheless NNP

the DT

said NN
, ,
and CC
she PRP
walked VBP
out RP

They PRP
were VBD
laughing VBN
at IN
the DT
chemist NN
as IN
well RB
as RB
at IN
the DT

To TO
find VB
anyone NN
still RB
proud JJ
, ,
anyone NN
who WP
believed VBP
in IN
giants NN
or CC
shame NN
, ,
was VBD
hilarious VBN

The DT
air NN
of IN
the DT

was VBD
acrid VBN
with IN
triumph NN

Finding JJ
someone NN
even RB
more RBR
vulnerable JJ

we PRP
were VBD
, ,
after IN
everything NN
had VBD
been VBN
taken VBN

— :
that WDT
was VBD
a DT

But CC
I PRP
followed VBP
the DT
traveler NN
, ,
into IN
the DT
wet JJ
streets NNS

The DT
smell NN
of IN
fish JJ
oozed NN
from IN

Here RB

there EX

bits VBN

I PRP
caught VBP
her PRP
at IN

She VB
invited JJ

Her NNP

were VBD
weathered VBN

She JJ

a DT

My JJ

I PRP

that WDT
they PRP

read VB
it PRP

him PRP
even RB
more RBR

Even RB
then RB
, ,
at IN
the DT
tender JJ
age NN
of IN
eight NN
and CC
with IN
half PDT
my PRP$
mind NN
gone NN
, ,
I PRP

becoming VBN
a DT
superlative JJ
observer NN

But CC
I PRP
did VBD
n't RB
know VB
what WP

I PRP
had VBD

seen VBN
much RB
of IN
Pag JJ
lately NN

I PRP
was VBD
pretty RB
sure JJ
he PRP

been VBN
avoiding JJ
me NN

Still RB
, ,
when WRB
your PRP$
best JJS
friend NN

in IN
trouble VBG
you PRP
help VB
out RP
, ,
right RB
? .

Even RB
if IN
the DT
odds NNS

impossible JJ
— :
and CC
how WRB
many JJ
eight-year-olds NN
would MD
go VB
up RP
against IN
six CD
bigger JJR
kids NNS
for IN
a DT
sandbox JJ
buddy NN
? .
— :
at IN
least JJS
you PRP
call VBP

backup NN
. .

Flag VB
a DT
sentry NN
. .

Something NN
. .

I PRP
just RB
stood VB
there RB
. .

I PRP
did VBD
n't RB
even RB
especially RB
want VBP
to TO
help VB
him PRP
. .

That DT
did VBD
n't RB
make VB
sense NN

Even RB
if IN
he PRP
had VBD
n't RB
been VBN
my PRP$
best JJS
friend NN
, ,
I PRP
should MD
at IN
least JJS
have VBP
empathized RB

I PRP
'd VBP
suffered RB
less RBR

Pag NN
in IN
the DT
way NN
of IN
overt NNP
violence NNP
; :
my PRP$
seizures JJ
tended NN
to TO
keep VB
the DT
other JJ
kids NNS
at IN
a DT
distance NN
, ,
scared VB
them PRP
even RB
as IN
they PRP
incapacitated VBP
me RB
. .

Still RB
. .

I PRP
was VBD
no DT
stranger NN
to IN
the DT
taunts NN
and CC
insults NN
, ,
or CC
the DT
foot NN
that IN

from IN
nowhere NN
to TO
trip VB
you PRP
up RP

route NN
from IN
A DT

B NN

I PRP
knew VBZ
how WRB
that DT

. .

Or CC
I PRP
had VBD
, ,
once RB

But CC
that DT
part NN
of IN
me NNP
had VBD
been VBN
cut VBN
out RP
along IN
with IN
the DT
bad JJ
wiring NN
. .

I PRP
was VBD
still RB
working VBG
up RP
the DT
algorithms NN
to TO
get VB
it PRP
back RB
, ,
still RB
learning VBG
by IN
observation NN
. .

Pack VB
animals RB
always RB
tear VB
apart RB
the DT
weaklings NN
in IN
their PRP$
midst NN
. .

Every DT
child JJ
knows NN
that IN
much JJ
instinctively NN

Maybe VB
I PRP
should MD
just RB
let VB
that DT
process NN
unfold NN
, ,
maybe RB
I PRP
should MD
n't RB
try VB
to TO
mess VB

nature NN

Then RB
again RB
, ,
Pag NNP

parents NN
had VBD
n't RB
messed VBN
with IN
nature NN
, ,
and CC
look VB
what WP
it PRP
got VBD
them PRP
: :
a DT
son JJ
curled NNS
up RP
in IN
the DT
dirt NN
while IN
a DT
bunch NN
of IN
engineered NNP
superboys NNP
kicked NNP
in IN
his PRP$
ribs NN
. .

In IN
the DT
end NN
, ,
propaganda JJ
worked NNS
where WRB
empathy JJ
failed NN
. .

Back VB
then RB
I PRP
did VBD
n't RB
so RB
much RB
think VB
as IN
observe NN
, ,
did VBD
n't RB
deduce VB
so RB
much RB
as IN
remember NNP
— :
and CC
what WP
I PRP
remembered VBP
was VBD
a DT
thousand JJ
inspirational NN
stories VBZ
lauding JJ
anyone NN
who WP
ever VBD
stuck VBN
up RP
for IN
the DT
underdog NN
. .

So RB
I PRP
picked VBD
up RP
a DT
rock NN
the DT
size NN
of IN
my PRP$
fist NN
and CC
hit VB
two CD
of IN
Pag NNP

assailants NN
across IN
the DT
backs NN
of IN
their PRP$
heads NNS
before IN
anyone NN
even RB
knew VB
I PRP
was VBD
in IN
the DT
game NN

A DT
third NN
, ,
turning VBG

face VB
the DT
new JJ
threat NN
, ,
took VBD
a DT
blow NN
to IN
the DT
face NN
that WDT
audibly MD
crunched VB
the DT
bones NN
of IN
his PRP$
cheek NN
. .

I PRP
remember VBP
wondering VBG
why WRB
I PRP
did VBD
n't RB
take VB
any DT
satisfaction NN
from IN
that DT
sound NN
, ,
why WRB
it PRP
meant VBN
nothing NN
beyond IN
the DT
fact NN
I PRP
had VBD
one CD
less RBR
opponent JJ
to TO
worry VB
about RB
. .

The DT
rest NN
of IN
them PRP
ran VBP
at IN
the DT
sight NN
of IN
blood NN
. .

One CD
of IN
the DT
braver JJ
promised NN
me IN
I PRP
was VBD
dead RB
, ,
shouted FW
" ''
Fucking NN
zombie NN

" ''
over IN
his PRP$
shoulder NN
as IN
he PRP
disappeared VBP
around IN
the DT
corner NN
. .

Three CD
decades NNS
it PRP
took VBD
, ,
to TO
see VB
the DT
irony NN
in IN
that DT
remark NN
. .

Two CD
of IN
the DT
enemy JJ
twitched NN
at IN
my PRP$
feet NNS

I PRP
kicked VBP
one CD
in IN
the DT
head NN
until IN
it PRP
stopped VBP
moving VBG
, ,
turned VBD
to IN
the DT
other JJ

Something RB
grabbed VB
my PRP$
arm NN
and CC
I JJ
swung NN
without IN

, ,
without IN
looking VBG
until IN
Pag NNP
yelped NNP
and CC
ducked VB
out RP

" ``
Oh NNP

" ``
I JJ
said NN

" ``
Sorry NN

" ''

One CD
thing NN
lay NN
motionless NN

The DT
other JJ
moaned NN
and CC
held VB
its PRP$
head NN
and CC
curled VB
up RP
in IN
a DT
ball NN
. .

" ``
Oh NNP
shit NNP

" ``
Pag NNP
panted NNP

Blood VB
coursed JJ
unheeded NN
from IN
his PRP$
nose NN
and CC
splattered VB
down RP
his PRP$

His PRP$
cheek NN
was VBD
turning RB
blue JJ
and CC
yellow JJ

" ``
Oh NNP

He PRP

Blood RB
smeared VB
the DT

his PRP$

" ``

" ``
They PRP

" ``
Yeah NNP

The DT

crawling VBN

all DT

I PRP
wondered VBZ
how WRB
long RB
it PRP

I PRP
wondered VBP
if IN
I PRP

" ``
You PRP

I PRP
actually RB

I PRP

I PRP

I PRP

I PRP

It PRP

my PRP$

very RB
hard JJ

The DT
