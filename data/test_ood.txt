When WRB
Tyler NNP
was VBD
very RB
young JJ
, ,
his PRP$
grandmother NN
was VBD
his PRP$
favorite JJ
person NN
in IN
the DT
world NN
because IN
, ,
unlike IN
his PRP$
parents NNS
, ,
who WP
believed VBD
that IN
children NNS
should MD
always RB
be VB
told VBN
the DT
truth NN
as IN
adults NNS
understood VBD
it PRP
, ,
she PRP
would MD
fill VB
in IN
the DT
gaps NNS
in IN
his PRP$
knowledge NN
— :
Santa NNP
Claus NNP
, ,
the DT
Easter NNP
Bunny NNP
, ,
God NNP

His PRP$
parents NNS
were VBD
always RB
too RB
busy JJ
and CC
often RB
a DT
little JJ
too RB
serious JJ
, ,
but CC
his PRP$
grandmother NN
had VBD
a DT
sense NN
of IN
peace NN
about IN
her PRP
, ,
a DT
lightness NN
that WDT
lifted VBD
his PRP$
spirit NN
. .

A DT
few JJ
times NNS
, ,
when WRB
Tyler NNP
’s POS
parents NNS
were VBD
away RB
, ,
she PRP
took VBD
him PRP
with IN
her PRP
to IN
church NN

He PRP
remembered VBD
liking VBG
the DT
singing NN
and CC
the DT
colorful JJ
windows NNS
, ,
and CC
how WRB
safe JJ
he PRP
felt VBD
there RB
, ,
in IN
that DT
large JJ
, ,
empty JJ
space NN
, ,
sitting VBG
on IN
a DT
hard JJ
bench NN
next RB
to IN
her PRP$
warmth NN

When WRB
she PRP
died VBD
, ,
grief NN
overwhelmed VBN
Tyler NNP
. .

But CC
like IN
most JJS
adults NNS
, ,
when WRB
he PRP
grew VBD
older JJR
he PRP
could MD
only RB
recall VB
the DT
intensity NN
of IN
that DT
love NN
in IN
childhood NN
in IN
an DT
abstract JJ
way NN
. .

He PRP
made VBD
the DT
common JJ
error NN
of IN
identifying VBG
maturity NN
with IN
worth NN
, ,
and CC
assumed VBD
that IN
the DT
love NN
he PRP
had VBD
for IN
her PRP
as IN
a DT
young JJ
child NN
must MD
have VB
been VBN
lacking VBG
in IN
strength NN
and CC
depth NN
. .

For IN
many JJ
years NNS
after IN
her PRP$
death NN
, ,
however RB
, ,
Tyler NNP
was VBD
tortured VBN
by IN
the DT
memory NN
of IN
a DT
certain JJ
visit NN
from IN
her PRP
. .

He PRP
was VBD
five CD
or CC
so RB
, ,
and CC
they PRP
were VBD
playing VBG
some DT
board NN
game NN
at IN
the DT
kitchen NN
table NN
. .

As IN
he PRP
swung VBD
his PRP$
legs NNS
in IN
his PRP$
excitement NN
, ,
he PRP
kicked VBD
her PRP
repeatedly RB
in IN
the DT
shins NNS
. .

She PRP
asked VBD
him PRP
to TO
stop VB
, ,
and CC
he PRP
refused VBD
, ,
giggling VBG
. .

When WRB
she PRP
finally RB
frowned VBD
at IN
him PRP
and CC
threatened VBD
to TO
stop VB
playing VBG
if IN
he PRP
did VBD
n’t RB
stop VB
he PRP
told VBD
her PRP
to TO
go VB
to IN
Hell NNP
. .

In IN
Tyler NNP
’s POS
mind NN
he PRP
could MD
see VB
her PRP$
face NN
grow VB
taut JJ
, ,
lose VB
color NN
, ,
and CC
then RB
, ,
for IN
the DT
only JJ
time NN
he PRP
could MD
remember VB
, ,
she PRP
began VBD
to TO
cry VB
. .

He PRP
also RB
remembered VBD
his PRP$
own JJ
utter JJ
confusion NN
. .

His PRP$
parents NNS
did VBD
not RB
have VB
much JJ
use NN
for IN
religion NN
and CC
so RB
for IN
him PRP
Hell NNP
was VBD
a DT
word NN
without IN
much JJ
mystery NN
or CC
power NN
. .

At IN
that DT
time NN
he PRP
knew VBD
only RB
vaguely RB
that IN
Hell NNP
was VBD
a DT
place NN
you PRP
did VBD
not RB
want VB
to TO
go VB
, ,
like IN
the DT
dark JJ
basement NN
or CC
the DT
even RB
darker JJR
attic NN
. .

He PRP
remembered VBD
feeling VBG
resentful JJ
that IN
she PRP
was VBD
crying VBG
and CC
he PRP
did VBD
not RB
even RB
understand VB
why WRB
. .

Tyler NNP
felt VBD
the DT
guilt NN
of IN
this DT
memory NN
even RB
in IN
his PRP$
teenage JJ
years NNS
. .

For IN
him PRP
it PRP
summed VBD
up RP
all PDT
his PRP$
insecurities NNS
and CC
fears NNS
about IN
his PRP$
own JJ
cruelty NN
, ,
ignorance NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
possibility NN
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
, ,
in IN
reality NN
, ,
not RB
a DT
good JJ
person NN
. .

The DT
fact NN
that IN
he PRP
had VBD
caused VBN
someone NN
who WP
loved VBD
him PRP
such JJ
pain NN
with IN
so RB
little JJ
effort NN
and CC
understanding NN
troubled VBD
him PRP
deeply RB
. .

One CD
day NN
Tyler NNP
looked VBD
through IN
an DT
old JJ
family NN
photo NN
album NN
, ,
and CC
in IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
picture NN
of IN
the DT
kitchen NN
in IN
the DT
house NN
they PRP
used VBD
to TO
live VB
in IN
. .

He PRP
was VBD
surprised VBN
to TO
discover VB
that IN
the DT
small JJ
kitchen NN
contained VBD
a DT
central JJ
island NN
, ,
and CC
had VBD
no DT
space NN
for IN
the DT
table NN
in IN
his PRP$
memory NN
at IN
all DT
. .

With IN
the DT
discovery NN
of IN
that DT
single JJ
error NN
in IN
his PRP$
memory NN
came VBD
a DT
cascade NN
of IN
other JJ
revelations NNS
. .

Now RB
he PRP
remembered VBD
that IN
they PRP
always RB
ate VBD
in IN
the DT
dining NN
room NN
, ,
and CC
when WRB
they PRP
did VBD
play VB
board NN
games NNS
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
always RB
on IN
the DT
coffee NN
table NN
in IN
the DT
living NN
room NN
. .

The DT
memory NN
that WDT
had VBD
caused VBN
him PRP
such JJ
pain NN
over IN
the DT
years NNS
could MD
not RB
possibly RB
have VB
occurred VBN
. .

Somehow RB
, ,
he PRP
must MD
have VB
manufactured VBN
the DT
whole JJ
scene NN
in IN
his PRP$
imagination NN
. .

It PRP
was VBD
not RB
very RB
hard JJ
to TO
explain VB
what WP
really RB
happened VBD
, ,
he PRP
thought VBD
. .

The DT
death NN
of IN
his PRP$
grandmother NN
had VBD
probably RB
caused VBN
in IN
him PRP
feelings NNS
of IN
abandonment NN
and CC
guilt NN
. .

In IN
his PRP$
confusion NN
he PRP
had VBD
taken VBN
elements NNS
from IN
storybooks NNS
and CC
imagined VBN
out IN
of IN
nothing NN
this DT
memory NN
to TO
punish VB
himself PRP
. .

This DT
was VBD
the DT
sort NN
of IN
fantasy NN
that WDT
could MD
have VB
occurred VBN
to IN
any DT
young JJ
child NN
who WP
lost VBD
an DT
important JJ
relative NN
. .

With IN
that DT
realization NN
, ,
the DT
image NN
of IN
his PRP$
grandmother NN
crying VBG
faded VBD
in IN
his PRP$
memory NN
and CC
became VBD
less RBR
and CC
less RBR
believable JJ
. .

Tyler NNP
thought VBD
he PRP
was VBD
very RB
lucky JJ
to TO
have VB
discovered VBN
the DT
single JJ
error NN
in IN
his PRP$
false JJ
memory NN
, ,
which WDT
enabled VBD
him PRP
to TO
reason VB
his PRP$
way NN
into IN
distinguishing VBG
between IN
reality NN
and CC
fantasy NN
. .

He PRP
felt VBD
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
coming-of-age JJ
moment NN
. .

Nonetheless RB
, ,
he PRP
admitted VBD
to IN
himself PRP
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
a DT
little JJ
sad JJ
also RB
at IN
the DT
discovery NN
. .

For IN
however RB
imaginary JJ
that DT
memory NN
was VBD
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
also RB
a DT
part NN
of IN
his PRP$
love NN
for IN
his PRP$
grandmother NN
. .

When WRB
that DT
memory NN
lost VBD
its PRP$
compelling JJ
aura NN
of IN
truth NN
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
like IN
another DT
part NN
of IN
her PRP
died VBD
with IN
it PRP
. .

He PRP
had VBD
no DT
name NN
for IN
the DT
emptiness NN
that WDT
remained VBD

The DT
Valley NNP
of IN
Giants NNPS

I PRP
had VBD
buried VBN
my PRP$
parents NNS
in IN
their PRP$
gray JJ
marble NN
mausoleum NN
at IN
the DT
heart NN
of IN
the DT

I PRP
had VBD
buried VBN
my PRP$

in IN
a DT

box NN
sunk VBN
into IN
the DT
mud NN
of IN
the DT
bottom NN
of IN
the DT
river NN
, ,
where WRB
all PDT
the DT
riverboatmen NNS
lie VBP

And CC
after IN
the DT
war NN
, ,
I PRP
had VBD
buried VBN
my PRP$
children NNS
, ,
all RB
four CD
, ,
in IN
white JJ
linen NN
shrouds NNS
in IN
the DT
new JJ
graveyards NNS
plowed VBN
into IN
what WP

our PRP$
farmland NN
: :
all PDT
the DT
land NN
stretching VBG
from IN
the DT
river NN
delta NN
to IN
the DT

I PRP
had VBD
one CD
granddaughter NN
who WP
survived VBD
the DT
war NN

I PRP
saw VBD
her PRP
sometimes RB
: :
in IN
a DT
bright JJ
pink JJ
dress NN
, ,
a DT
sparkling JJ
drink NN
in IN
her PRP$
hand NN
, ,
on IN
the DT
arm NN
of IN
some DT
foreign JJ
officer NN
with IN
brocade NN
on IN
his PRP$
shoulders NNS
, ,
at IN
the DT
edge NN
of IN
a DT
marble NN
patio NN

She PRP
never RB
looked VBD
back RB
at IN
me PRP
— :
poverty NN
and CC
failure NN
and CC
political JJ
disrepute NN
being VBG
all RB
, ,
these DT
days NNS
, ,
contagious JJ
and CC
synonymous JJ

The DT
young NN
were VBD
mostly RB
dead JJ

and CC
the DT
old JJ
men NNS
had VBD
been VBN
taken VBN
away RB
, ,
they PRP
told VBD

to TO

important JJ
new JJ
things NNS

to TO
come VB
back RB
when WRB
they PRP
were VBD
ready JJ

So RB
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
city NN
of IN
grandmothers NNS

And CC
it PRP
was VBD
in IN
a DT
grandmother NN
bar NN
by IN
the DT
waterfront NN
— :
sipping VBG
hot JJ
tea NN
with IN
rum NN
and CC
watching VBG
over IN
the DT
shoulders NNS
of IN
dockworkers NNS
playing VBG
mah-jongg NN
— :
that IN
I PRP
first RB
heard VBD
of IN
the DT
valley NN
of IN

We PRP
all RB
laughed VBD
at IN
the DT
idea NN

except IN
for IN
a DT
chemist NN
with IN
a DT
crooked JJ
nose NN
and CC
rouge NN
caked VBN
in IN
the DT

who WP

incensed VBN

“ ``

” ''
she PRP
cried VBD

“ ``
You PRP
should MD
be VB

" ''

The DT
traveler NN
stood VBD
up RP
from IN
the DT
table NN

She PRP
was VBD
bony JJ
and CC
rough-skinned JJ
and CC
bent JJ
like IN
an DT
old JJ
crow NN
, ,
with IN
a DT
blue JJ
silk NN
scarf NN
and CC
hanks NNS
of IN
hair NN
as IN

as IN

Her PRP$
eyes NNS
were VBD
veined VBN
with IN
red NN

“ ``
Nonetheless RB

” ''
the DT
traveler NN
said VBD
, ,
and CC
she PRP
walked VBD
out IN

They PRP
were VBD
laughing VBG
at IN
the DT
chemist NN
as IN
well RB
as IN
at IN
the DT

To TO
find VB
anyone NN
still RB
proud JJ
, ,
anyone NN
who WP
believed VBD
in IN
giants NNS
or CC
shame NN
, ,
was VBD
hilarious JJ

The DT
air NN
of IN
the DT
bar NN
was VBD
acrid JJ
with IN
triumph NN

Finding VBG
someone NN
even RB
more JJR
vulnerable JJ

foolish JJ
than IN
we PRP
were VBD
, ,
after IN
everything NN
had VBD
been VBN
taken VBN
from IN
us PRP
— :
that WDT
was VBD
a DT
delight NN

But CC
I PRP
followed VBD
the DT
traveler NN
, ,
into IN
the DT
wet JJ
streets NNS

The DT
smell NN
of IN
fish NN
oozed VBD
from IN
the DT
docks NNS

Here RB
and CC
there RB
were VBD
bits NNS

I PRP
caught VBD
her PRP
at IN
her PRP$

She PRP
invited VBD
me PRP
in IN
for IN
tea NN

Her PRP$

were VBD
weathered VBN

ringed VBN

like IN
the DT

She PRP

that WDT

in IN
a DT

a DT

A DT

In IN

the DT

the DT

I PRP

My PRP$

My PRP$

I PRP

I PRP

looking VBG

That DT

When WRB

she PRP

For IN

even RB

Even RB
then RB

at IN
the DT
tender JJ
age NN

eight CD

with IN
half PDT
my PRP$

gone VBN

I PRP

becoming VBG
a DT

But CC
I PRP

n't RB
know VB
what WP

I PRP

I PRP
was VBD
pretty RB
sure JJ
he PRP

Still RB
, ,
when WRB
your PRP$

you PRP

right JJ

Even RB
if IN
the DT

impossible JJ

and CC
how WRB
many JJ
eight-year-olds NNS

up RB

a DT

at IN

Flag VBP

Something NN

I PRP
just RB
stood VBD
there RB

I PRP
did VBD
n't RB
even RB
especially RB
want VB
to TO
help VB
him PRP

That DT
did VBD

make VB
sense NN

Even RB
if IN
he PRP

been VBN
my PRP$
best JJS

, ,
I PRP
should MD
at IN

I PRP

suffered VBN
less RBR

Pag NNP
in IN
the DT
way NN

my PRP$
seizures NNS
tended VBD

keep VB
the DT
other JJ
kids NNS
at IN
a DT

, ,
scared VBD
them PRP
even RB

Still RB

I PRP
was VBD
no DT
stranger NN
to IN
the DT

the DT

that WDT

you PRP
up RP

I PRP
knew VBD
how WRB
that DT

Or CC
I PRP
had VBD

once RB

But CC
that DT
part NN
of IN
me PRP
had VBD
been VBN
cut VBN
out RP
along IN

the DT
bad JJ
wiring NN

I PRP
was VBD
still RB
working VBG
up RP
the DT
algorithms NNS

get VB
it PRP
back RB

still RB
learning VBG
by IN
observation NN

Pack NN
animals NNS
always RB
tear VBP
apart RB
the DT
weaklings NNS
in IN
their PRP$

Every DT

knows VBZ
that DT
much JJ
instinctively RB

Maybe RB
I PRP
should MD
just RB
let VB
that DT

maybe RB
I PRP
should MD
n't RB
try VB

mess VB

Then RB
again RB
, ,
Pag NNP

parents NNS

messed VBN

look VB
what WP
it PRP

them PRP
: :
a DT

curled VBN
up RP

the DT
dirt NN
while IN
a DT

superboys NNS
kicked VBD
in IN
his PRP$

In IN
the DT
end NN
, ,
propaganda NN
worked VBD
where WRB

failed VBD

Back RB
then RB
I PRP
did VBD
n't RB
so RB
much RB
think VB
as IN

did VBD

deduce VB
so RB
much RB

what WP
I PRP

a DT
thousand CD
inspirational JJ
stories NNS
lauding VBG
anyone NN
who WP

up RP

So RB
I PRP
picked VBD
up RP
a DT
rock NN
the DT

my PRP$

hit VBD
two CD

Pag NNP

before IN
anyone NN
even RB

I PRP

A DT
third JJ

turning VBG

the DT

took VBD
a DT
blow NN
to IN
the DT
face NN
that WDT
audibly RB
crunched VBD
the DT
bones NNS
of IN
his PRP$

I PRP
remember VBP
wondering VBG
why WRB
I PRP
did VBD
n't RB
take VB
any DT

from IN
that DT

why WRB
it PRP
meant VBD
nothing NN
beyond IN
the DT
fact NN
I PRP
had VBD
one CD

The DT
rest NN

ran VBD

the DT
sight NN

One CD

the DT
braver JJR

I PRP

dead JJ

" ``

over IN
his PRP$

as IN
he PRP
disappeared VBD
around IN
the DT
corner NN

Three CD
decades NNS
it PRP
took VBD

to TO
see VB
the DT
irony NN
in IN
that DT

Two CD

the DT
enemy NN
twitched VBD

my PRP$

I PRP
kicked VBD
one CD
in IN
the DT
head NN
until IN
it PRP
stopped VBD
moving VBG

turned VBD

the DT
other NN

Something NN
grabbed VBD
my PRP$
arm NN
and CC
I PRP
swung VBD
without IN

without IN

until IN
Pag NNP
yelped VBD

ducked VBD
out IN

" ``
Oh UH

I PRP

" ``
Sorry JJ

One CD

lay VBD
motionless JJ

The DT

moaned VBD

held VBD

and CC
curled VBD
up RP
in IN
a DT

" ``
Oh UH

Pag NNP
panted VBD

Blood NN
coursed VBD
unheeded JJ
from IN
his PRP$

splattered VBD
down IN

His PRP$

" ``

He PRP

Blood NN

The DT

I PRP

I PRP

I PRP

I PRP

I PRP
